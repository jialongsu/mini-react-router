# &lt;Link>

Provide declarative, accessible navigation around your application.

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-native";

<Link to="/about">
  <Text>About</Text>
</Link>;
```

## to: string

A string representation of the location to link to, created by concatenating the location's pathname, search, and hash properties.

```jsx
<Link to="/courses?sort=name" />
```

## to: object

An object that can have any of the following properties:

- `pathname`: A string representing the path to link to.
- `search`: A string representation of query parameters, e.g. `?key=value`.
- `hash`: A hash to put in the URL, e.g. `#a-hash`.
- `state`: State to persist to the `location`.

```jsx
<Link
  to={{
    pathname: "/courses",
    search: "?sort=name",
    hash: "#the-hash",
    state: { fromDashboard: true }
  }}
/>
```

## replace: bool

When `true`, clicking the link will replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one.

```jsx
<Link to="/courses" replace />
```

## component: func

A component for making `Link` respond properly to touches. Typically will be one React Native's "touchable" components (`TouchableHighlight`, `TouchableOpacity`, etc). All props passed to `Link` will be passed along to this component. Defaults to `TouchableHighlight`.

```jsx
<Link to="/about" component={TouchableOpacity} activeOpacity={0.8} />
```
