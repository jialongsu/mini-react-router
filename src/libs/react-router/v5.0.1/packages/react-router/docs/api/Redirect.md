# &lt;Redirect>

Rendering a `<Redirect>` will navigate to a new location. The new location will override the current location in the history stack, like server-side redirects (HTTP 3xx) do.

```jsx
<Route exact path="/">
  {loggedIn ? <Redirect to="/dashboard" /> : <PublicHomePage />}
</Route>
```

## to: string

The URL to redirect to. Any valid URL path that [`path-to-regexp@^1.7.0`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v1.7.0) understands.
All URL parameters that are used in `to` must be covered by `from`.

```jsx
<Redirect to="/somewhere/else" />
```

## to: object

A location to redirect to. `pathname` can be any valid URL path that [`path-to-regexp@^1.7.0`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v1.7.0) understands.

```jsx
<Redirect
  to={{
    pathname: "/login",
    search: "?utm=your+face",
    state: { referrer: currentLocation }
  }}
/>
```

The `state` object can be accessed via `this.props.location.state` in the redirected-to component. This new `referrer` key (which is not a special name) would then be accessed via `this.props.location.state.referrer` in the `Login` component pointed to by the pathname `'/login'`

## push: bool

When `true`, redirecting will push a new entry onto the history instead of replacing the current one.

```jsx
<Redirect push to="/somewhere/else" />
```

## from: string

A pathname to redirect from. Any valid URL path that [`path-to-regexp@^1.7.0`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v1.7.0) understands.
All matched URL parameters are provided to the pattern in `to`. Must contain all parameters that are used in `to`. Additional parameters not used by `to` are ignored.

**Note:** This can only be used to match a location when rendering a `<Redirect>` inside of a `<Switch>`. See [`<Switch children>`](./Switch.md#children-node) for more details.

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Redirect from="/old-path" to="/new-path" />
  <Route path="/new-path">
    <Place />
  </Route>
</Switch>

// Redirect with matched parameters
<Switch>
  <Redirect from="/users/:id" to="/users/profile/:id" />
  <Route path="/users/profile/:id">
    <Profile />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

## exact: bool

Match `from` exactly; equivalent to [Route.exact](./Route.md#exact-bool).

**Note:** This can only be used in conjunction with `from` to exactly match a location when rendering a `<Redirect>` inside of a `<Switch>`. See [`<Switch children>`](./Switch.md#children-node) for more details.

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Redirect exact from="/" to="/home" />
  <Route path="/home">
    <Home />
  </Route>
  <Route path="/about">
    <About />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

## strict: bool

Match `from` strictly; equivalent to [Route.strict](./Route.md#strict-bool).

**Note:** This can only be used in conjunction with `from` to strictly match a location when rendering a `<Redirect>` inside of a `<Switch>`. See [`<Switch children>`](./Switch.md#children-node) for more details.

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Redirect strict from="/one/" to="/home" />
  <Route path="/home">
    <Home />
  </Route>
  <Route path="/about">
    <About />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

## sensitive: bool

Match `from` case sensitive; equivalent to [Route.sensitive](./Route.md#sensitive-bool).
