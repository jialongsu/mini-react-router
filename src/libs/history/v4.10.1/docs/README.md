Welcome to the history docs! The library isn't huge, so there are really just a few files here for you to browse.

If this is your first time here, I'd recommend you first [install](Installation.md) the library and then read both:

- [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md)
- [Navigation](Navigation.md)

For more advanced usage, check out:

- [Blocking](Blocking.md) - Details about how to block navigation attempts
- [Misc](Misc.md) - Miscellaneous topics about several API details
